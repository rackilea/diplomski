//this loop says that for int i, exicute the block of code
    //and then increment i once for each pass through the loop
    //and do this for as long as i is <= Acent/2
    for(int i = 1;i<=Acent/2;i++){

          System.out.print("*");
        }
        System.out.println(" A");// this formats the letter at end of *
