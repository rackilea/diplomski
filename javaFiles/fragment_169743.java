1. i ran your code in my IDE

2. import java.util.Arrays;

3. since you still have error i press `ctrl` then hover to `import java.util.Arrays;` which leads me to the `Arrays.class`

4. look to the hierarchy of the packages and looked where it came from `rt.jar` which contains all of the compiled class files for the base Java Runtime environment.
