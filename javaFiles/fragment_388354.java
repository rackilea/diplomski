l == k => your algorithm is obviously correct, since it's clear that
          it doesn't produce invalid solutions;

l > k => this would contradict our hypothesis that i1, ..., ik is optimal,
         so it makes no sense to bother with this;

l < k => this would mean that your algorithm is wrong. 
         Let's assume this is the case.
