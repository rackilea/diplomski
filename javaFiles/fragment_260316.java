If the length is negative then {
    Ask for a new length until it's positive
}
// When we get here, the length will be positive.  It doesn't matter 
// whether we got here because the original length was positive, or whether
// it was negative and the user entered a new value.  We're going to 
// continue in the same way, either way.
Input the width, reject negative values, do the computation,
and output it
