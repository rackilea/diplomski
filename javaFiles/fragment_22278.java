/**
 * Bootstrap loader for Catalina.  This application constructs a class loader
 * for use in loading the Catalina internal classes (by accumulating all of the
 * JAR files found in the "server" directory under "catalina.home"), and
 * starts the regular execution of the container.  The purpose of this
 * roundabout approach is to keep the Catalina internal classes (and any
 * other classes they depend on, such as an XML parser) out of the system
 * class path and therefore not visible to application level classes.
