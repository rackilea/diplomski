* Pretty sweet Org heading

  This is an org-mode file, which is cool for lots of reasons, e.g.

  - it's Emacs, and
  - it supports syntax-highlighted blocks
    - (note that this requires the variable ~org-src-fontify-natively~
      to be set to ~t~)

#+BEGIN_SRC java
  public class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, World");
      }
  }
#+END_SRC
