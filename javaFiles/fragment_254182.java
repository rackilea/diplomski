/**
 * Returns a hash code value for the object. This method is
 * supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by
 * {@link java.util.HashMap}.
 * <p>
 * The general contract of {@code hashCode} is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during
 *     an execution of a Java application, the {@code hashCode} method
 *     must consistently return the same integer, provided no information
 *     used in {@code equals} comparisons on the object is modified.
 *     This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
 *     application to another execution of the same application.
 * <li>If two objects are equal according to the {@code equals(Object)}
 *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of
 *     the two objects must produce the same integer result.
 * <li>It is <em>not</em> required that if two objects are unequal
 *     according to the {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)}
 *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of the
 *     two objects must produce distinct integer results.  However, the
 *     programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results
 *     for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by
 * class {@code Object} does return distinct integers for distinct
 * objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal
 * address of the object into an integer, but this implementation
 * technique is not required by the
 * Java&trade; programming language.)
 *
 * @return  a hash code value for this object.
 * @see     java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)
 * @see     java.lang.System#identityHashCode
