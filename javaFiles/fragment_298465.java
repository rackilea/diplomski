public void mySpeedChecker(){
// assuming steps taken stored in a global variable
// and there is one more variable which is updated by this function 
// to store number of steps before as global variable to calculate number of steps in time interval. 
// this should check if another step has been taken in the interval to check
// if stepsTaken>0 then speed is not zero and you'll know how much steps are taken
// if zero steps are taken then speed is zero 
// also it will tell you number of steps taken in last second 
// so you can use this to calculate and update speed 
// increase the interval for high accuracy but lower frequency of updates
