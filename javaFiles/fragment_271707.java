Undefined step: When  i run the test

You can implement missing steps with the snippets below:
@Given("^i have a test$")

public void i_have_a_test() throws Throwable {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new PendingException();
}

@When("^i run the test$")
public void i_run_the_test() throws Throwable {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new PendingException();
}

@Then("^i have a working test$")
public void i_have_a_working_test() throws Throwable {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new PendingException();
}
