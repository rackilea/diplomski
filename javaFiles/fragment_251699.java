foo = {1,2,3,4,5}; //Assuming the array list is called foo

//The permutation array is [0,1,1,1,2] in your case
//Start traversing it backwards, you can do that with a simple loop
//So given the array a = [0,1,1,1,2], you start with a[4]

a[4] = 2;
//This implies the number you are looking for is at the 3rd last position of the array list
