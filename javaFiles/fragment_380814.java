All offending characters are replaced by a % and a two digit hexadecimal value 
that represents the character in the proper ISO character set. Here are a 
couple of examples:

$ (Dollar Sign) becomes %24
& (Ampersand) becomes %26
+ (Plus) becomes %2B
, (Comma) becomes %2C
: (Colon) becomes %3A
; (Semi-Colon) becomes %3B
= (Equals) becomes %3D
? (Question Mark) becomes %3F
@ (Commercial A / At) becomes %40
