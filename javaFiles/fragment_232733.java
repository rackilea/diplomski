// This is a method declaration. It says it returns an integer
// and it accepts two integers as its arguments.
int addTwoNumbers(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Somewhere in the code, you could call this method by passing
// two integers in there:
int number1 = 1;
int number2 = 10;
int result = someobject.addTwoNumbers(a, b);
// result is now 11.
