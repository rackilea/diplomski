/**
 * Returns a fixed-size list backed by the specified array.  (Changes to

 * serializable and implements {@link RandomAccess}.
 *
 * <p>This method also provides a convenient way to create a fixed-size
 * list initialized to contain several elements:
 * <pre>
 *     List&lt;String&gt; stooges = Arrays.asList("Larry", "Moe", "Curly");
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param a the array by which the list will be backed
 * @return a list view of the specified array
