ˆ                  Incorrect character 'ˆ', should be '^'
                   Match start of input, but your input starts with '['
(                  
  [\d]+            The '[]' is superfluous, use '\d+'
  (\.[\d]{2})?     Don't capture this, use '(?:X)?'
  \|
  ([A-Z]{2}){1}    The '{1}` is superfluous, and don't capture just this
)                  You're capturing too much. Move back to before '\|'
(,[A-Z]{2})*       Will only capture last ',XX'.
                   Use a capture group around all the letters, then split that on ','
\s
(\".+\")?          No need to escape '"', and only capture the content
$                  Match end of input, but your input ends with ']'
