()  - match everything inside the parentheses (later, the "match" gets replaced with "space")
\\  - an 'escaped' backslash (i.e. an actual backslash; the first one "protects" the second
      so it is not interpreted as a special character
.   - any character (I saw 'u', but there might be others
\d  - a digit
{3,} - "at least three"
.*? - any characters, "lazy" (stop as soon as possible)
\s  - until you hit a white space
|   - or
()  - one of these things
\\r - backslash - r (again, with escaped '\')
\\n - backslash - n
