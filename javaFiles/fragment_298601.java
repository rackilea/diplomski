List of paths (separated by ;) to search for additional JMeter plugin classes,
 for example new GUI elements and samplers.
 A path item can either be a jar file or a directory.
 Any jar file in such a directory will be automatically included,
 jar files in sub directories are ignored.
 The given value is in addition to any jars found in the lib/ext directory.
 Do not use this for utility or plugin dependency jars.
