/**
 * Waits at most {@code millis} milliseconds for this thread to

 * {@code this.notifyAll} method is invoked. It is recommended that
 * applications not use {@code wait}, {@code notify}, or
 * {@code notifyAll} on {@code Thread} instances.
 *
 * @param  millis
 *         the time to wait in milliseconds
 *
 * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
 *          if the value of {@code millis} is negative
 *
 * @throws  InterruptedException
 *          if any thread has interrupted the current thread. The
 *          <i>interrupted status</i> of the current thread is
 *          cleared when this exception is thrown.
