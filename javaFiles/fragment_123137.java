//Declare your hashmap:
Map <String, String> myAnswers = new HashMap<>();

 /*
 *Put the values you want
 *The put method takes in two parameters, the key and the value.
 *The key represents the name you want to call this element by.
 *The value is the actual value (so to speak)
 */

myAnswers.put("firstQuestion", "Answer of firstQuestion");
myAnswers.put("secondQuestion", "Answer of secondQuestion");
myAnswers.put("thirdQuestion", "Answer of thirdQuestion");

//You can go on and on: key, value.. Just like we did up there.
