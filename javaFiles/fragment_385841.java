    I m writing this review after using 2 months..
    First of all ..I must say this is one of the best product ..camera quality is best in natural lights or daytime..but in low light and in the night..camera quality is not so good but it's ok..
    It has good battery backup ..last one day on 3g usage ..while using 4g ..it lasts for about 10-12 hour..
    Turbo charges is good..although ..my charger is not working..
    Only problem in this phone is ..while charging..this phone heats a lot..this may b becoz of turbo charger..if u r using other charger than it does not heat..
