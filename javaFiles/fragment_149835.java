     * Acquires the lock unless the current thread is
     * {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted}.
     *
     * <p>Acquires the lock if it is available and returns immediately.
     *
     * <p>If the lock is not available then the current thread becomes
     * disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
     * one of two things happens:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>The lock is acquired by the current thread; or
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts} the
     * current thread, and interruption of lock acquisition is supported.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If the current thread:
     * <ul>
     * <li>has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
     * <li>is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while acquiring the
     * lock, and interruption of lock acquisition is supported,
     * </ul>
     * then {@link InterruptedException} is thrown and the current thread's
     * interrupted status is cleared.
