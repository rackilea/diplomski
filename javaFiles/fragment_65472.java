f, F   The double argument is rounded and converted to decimal notation
          in the style [-]ddd.ddd, where the number of  digits  after  the
          decimal-point character is equal to the precision specification.
          If the precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the  precision
          is  explicitly  zero,  no decimal-point character appears.  If a
          decimal point appears, at least one digit appears before it.
