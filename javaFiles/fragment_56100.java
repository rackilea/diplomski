String s = 2+"ABC";

  // This will convert int 2 to String and add it to variable s

String s = 2+2+"ABC";

  // This will sum up 2's and then add them to String. This is because java
  // is read from left to right, and you can add logic in variable initialization

String s = 2+(2+"ABC");

  // This should work as you want it
