Hashmap fourdigitcodes;

//check if first digit is 7
if(firstdigit==7)
  //country definitely russia
else
   if country code begins with 1.
     Check the first four digits are in the hashmap with four digit codes and return the value 
     if no value is found then answer is certainly usa.
otherwise
     String country="";
     HashMap<String,String> ccode = new HashMap<String,String>();
     ccode.put("353","Ireland");//List all country codes
     ccode.put("49","Germany");
     String value = ccode.get("49");//See if I have a value for the first 2 digits
     if(value != null){
      country = value; //If I found a country for the first two digits we are done as the              first two digits of the country code consisting of two digits cannot be in a country code with 3
     }else{
      the country is certainly 3 digit. return the first three digits by entering the first 3 digits as the key of the hashmap countaining the first three digits. 
     }
